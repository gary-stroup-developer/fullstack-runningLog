                            <p>Plan workouts that will help you achieve your goals. A goal of running
                            a half-marathon will involve running more miles. Ideally you would map
                            out your timeline to start with a solid base with a gradual increase in
                            mileage over time.</p>

                            <p>Break It Up</p>
                            <p>Large goals are best achieved by breaking them into smaller goals.
                            Smaller goals are attainable faster and act as stepping stones to the
                            final goal. The benefit of consistently achieving these smaller goals is
                            an increased confidence level that provides the motivation to continue
                            on your journey.</p>

                            will determine if you are on track. This will allow you to make adjustments
